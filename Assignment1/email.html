            <p>Dear Ramesh</p>
            <p>I hope you are well. It has been a long time since I have messaged you. How is everyone. I recently heard that your son has completed his graduation. Do convey my regards to him. </p>
            <p>I am pleased to let you know that my daughter has also completed her graduation. She is currently posted as a Marketing Associate in Bangalore.
                If my memory serves me well, you last saw her when she was 10, so it is unlikely that you would recognize her.
                 I have added an image of hers for you to see. </p>

            <p>
                It is funny that there is a lifetime of things to talk about, but I seem lost for words to write.
                I am retiring soon. I would love to catch up with you on all the old memories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expecting news from your end.
