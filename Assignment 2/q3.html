    <h1 class="title">The Wonders of Nature</h1>

    <h2>Beauty of the Oceans</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">ocean</span> is a vast and mysterious place, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface. 
        It is home to <span class="highlight">millions</span> of species, many of which are yet to be discovered. 
        The beauty of <span class="highlight">coral reefs</span>, the deep-sea trenches, and the rhythmic waves captivate anyone 
        who takes the time to appreciate the wonders of marine life. 
        Protecting our oceans is essential, as they play a crucial role in regulating 
        the Earth's climate and supporting <span class="highlight">biodiversity</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Power of the Mountains</h2>
    <p>
        Mountains are a symbol of <span class="highlight">strength</span> and resilience, standing tall through the ages. 
        They provide fresh water, support diverse ecosystems, and offer breathtaking views. 
        Many adventurers seek the <span class="highlight">thrill</span> of climbing towering peaks, while others 
        find peace in their majestic presence. From the mighty <span class="highlight">Himalayas</span> to the 
        snow-capped Alps, mountains shape weather patterns and sustain life. 
        Conservation efforts must be taken to preserve these natural wonders 
        for future generations to admire and explore.
    </p>

    <h2>The Magic of Forests</h2>
    <p>
        Forests are the <span class="highlight">lungs</span> of our planet, providing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide. 
        They are home to countless species, from the tiniest insects to the mightiest predators. 
        The Amazon Rainforest, often called the "<span class="highlight">Earth's lungs</span>," plays a significant role 
        in climate regulation. Deforestation poses a severe threat to biodiversity, 
        disrupting ecosystems and accelerating climate change. 
        By promoting <span class="highlight">reforestation</span> and responsible resource management, 
        we can ensure that forests continue to thrive and benefit future generations.
